Utility to import Forex CSV files from histdata.com into a MySQL DB.

Since volume information is always 0, that column is ignored.  The data time is modified to conform
to MySQL (seconds rather than microseconds).

To use simply modify the Perl script with the appropriate database address, database name, and
user credentials.

Enjoy!
